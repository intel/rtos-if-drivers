    Elkhart Lake GPIO Map

    Map from Elkhart Lake GPIO to component GPIO driver instances.

    The Elkhart Lake GPIO architecture provides six controllers each of
    which has more than 32 pins.  To be supported on Zephyr these pins
    must be mapped to sub-devices that have 32 pins each.
    This compatible is used to map the full controller to its
    subdevices.

compatible: "intel,elkhart-lake-gpio"

include: [gpio-nexus.yaml, base.yaml]
